Semi-supervised learning has emerged as an effective approach for reducing the reliance on labeled data in medical image segmentation. Nonetheless, the inherent class imbalance in medical images remains a limitation for this approach. Several recent methods have mitigated this issue through tailored designs. However, these methods rely on prior data bias for loss weighting to varying extents, which may lead to suboptimal performance when labeled data is scarce. To overcome this challenge, we propose a model property-aware learning framework that leverages intrinsic model properties to mitigate the bias from training. Specifically, a novel loss weighting mechanism is introduced. This mechanism exploits both the class-wise predictive uncertainty from the output layer and the class-wise feature compactness from an intermediate layer to quantify recognition difficulty per class, thereby enabling adaptive loss weighting. Furthermore, we propose an entropy-based data augmentation strategy. This strategy crops the uncertainty regions of labeled data to sharpen the focus on minority classes. The remaining confidence regions are then combined with the uncertainty regions of unlabeled data to promote information propagation from labeled to unlabeled data. Owing to its plug-and-play nature, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated with several classical semi-supervised learning methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively enhances the performance of hard-to-recognize classes, achieving state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets.
